Typescript finally compiles the code to js but we have an issue here that is if we are using the tsc without compiling the compiled code is not desirable like.
1.it will have the older js features like no arrow fx,
2.var for variable declaration
3.not optimized code
4.need to specify the the file to compile every time

So we need the custom configuration to overcome all this issues
the steps are:
1. enable the ts config fil-  tsc --init
2. change the settings in the config file as required
